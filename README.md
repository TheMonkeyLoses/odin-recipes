This is the first project for the Odin Foundations course.
In this project I will build a basic functional recipe website demonstrating the following HTML skills:
- basic boilerplate with elements and tags
- styled text using headings, lists, and paragraphs
- images and links

This was all knowledge that I had prior to beginning this course, however, this  will be my first project practicing with Git, Github,
and commit messages.
