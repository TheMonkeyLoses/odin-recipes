<h4>Description</h4>
<p> Originally a recipe from Cushman's Bakery (which is now closed),
these wonderful bakery cookies are sure to please your taste buds.
They have a chewy interior while being crisp around the edges,
producing a perfect cookie texture that is freezer-friendly.</p>

<p>Credit for this wonderful recipe goes to u/NearKilroy on Reddit at r/old_recipes, who was looking into a murder that took place in their house. They found out that a neighbor in the 30s worked in Cushman's Bakery and this was their recipe of the year. The Reddit community has since lovingly dubbed these "Murder Cookies", and I'll never call them anything else. They're to die for!</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup crisco vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 & 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 & 1/2 tsp <em>fresh</em> baking soda **</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp mace</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk of choice</li>
        <li>sanding sugar (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <p> **Note: open a new box of baking soda if its more than a month old. It must be fresh for this recipe to produce the optimal cookie texture!</p>

   <h4>Steps</h4>
  
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Cream sugar, shortening, molasses, and egg. Sift dry ingredients and beat them into the creamed mixture with the milk.</li>
    <li>Mix until dough is formed. Then, using a heaping tablespoon of dough, roll into a ball roughly the size of a ping pong ball.</li>
    <li>Place dough balls on a parchment lined baking sheet. Lightly press the tops with the bottom of a drinking glass, just enough to create a flat top for the sanding sugar.</li>
    <li>If desired, sprinkle sanding sugar on top of the pressed dough.</li>
    <li>Bake cookies for 10-11 minutes. For optimal texture (chewy inside, crisp on the edges), remove cookies from the oven the moment the tops of the cookies no longer look glossy.</li>
    <li>Allow the cookies to fully cool on the baking tray.</li>
   </ol>
